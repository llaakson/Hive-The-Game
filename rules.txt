1. One Hive Rule:
- check that hive is still a single connected group
- graph connectivity

2. Freedom to move rule:
- a piece can only slide if it can more between neighbours without squeezing through a 1-hex gap (beetles are an exception - they can climb)
- check adjacent occupied hexes

3. Placement rules:
- first turn: anywhere
- later turns (placement): must place adjacent to own pieces, not opponents;
- queen must be placed between turns 2 - 4

4. Piece-specific movement rules:
- Queen: 1 step to any adjacent hex 
- Beetle: 1 step, but can climb onto other pieces
- Spider: exactly 3 steps, no backtracking
- Grasshopper: jump over straight line of pieces until first empty space
- Ant: slide unlimited spaces around Hive perimeter
- Ladybug: moves three spaces, two on the top of hive and one down
- Pillbug: moves one space at a time, but can also move an adjacent piece two spaces: one on the top of itself and one into another empty field next to itself
- Mosquito: takes on movement characteristics of any creature it touches
